SUMMARY

The solubilities of amino acids, diglycine, and triglycine
have been measured in water and aqueous ethanol as well as
dioxane solutions. Free energies of transfer of amino acid
side chains and backbone peptide units from water to ethanol
and dioxane solutions have been calculated from these data.
The results show the similarity between the effects of
ethanol and dioxane on the stability of those side chains and
peptide units. In particular, the free energies of transfer
of hydrophobic side chains to 100% ethanol and dioxane are
essentially identical, and have been used to establish a
hydrophobicity scale for hydrophobic side chains.

 

The solubility study of amino acids and two glycine peptides
reported in this paper represents the fourth of a series of such
studies. Earlier papers have dealt with solubilities in aqueous
urea (1, 2), ethylene glycol (3), and guanidine hydrochloride solu-
tions (4). The present investigation covers solubilities in aque-
ous ethanol and dioxane solutions. The measurements in ethanol
solutions partly duplicate earlier work by Dunn and Ross (5),
Cohn et al. (6), and McMeekin, Cohn, and Weare (7, 8). (A
comprehensive analysis of the earlier data is given by Cohn and
Edsall (9).) No previous measurements in dioxane solutions
have been reported.

A major purpose of all our previous studies has been to provide
a rational explanation for the ability of various solvent media to
promote protein denaturation. The process of denaturation is
accompanied by the exposure of protein moieties that are in the
“Gnside” of the native globular structure. If the freshly exposed
moieties interact more favorably with a particular solvent me-
dium than they do with water, that solvent medium will promote
denaturation. Solubility measurements of model compounds
that are similar except for the presence of a particular group in
the one compound and its absence in the other can yield, after
suitable thermodynamic manipulations and with simplifying as-
sumptions, quantitative values for the free energy of interaction

of such a group with a particular solvent, relative to the free en-
ergy of interaction with water, and thus allow quantitative pre-
dictions of the denaturing ability of any solvent relative to the
denaturing ability of water. No knowledge of the interaction
free energies within the native protein is necessary. The theory
and its application to denaturation equilibria have been discussed
elsewhere (10, 11). Application of some of the present data to
denaturation by cthanol and dioxane has already been briefly
treated (11).

Solubility measurements in ethanol and dioxane serve a
broader purpose, in that they provide a semiquantitative estimate
of interactions inside the native protein molecule for hydrophobic
moieties, relative to the interaction of the same moieties when
exposed to water. ‘The rationale here is that hydrocarbon groups
and other hydrophobic moieties have a strongly unfavorable in-
teraction with water, which is abolished when the group in ques-
tion is removed from contact with water and placed inside the
native structure, where such groups are not generally involved
in any strong favorable or unfavorable interactions with their en-
vironment. It has been suggested that 100% ethanol can serve
as a “model” for the inside of a protein molecule in this regard
(12), t.e. that the difference in free energy between a hydrophobic
moiety in 100% ethanol and in water is simply a measure of the
unfavorable free energy of interaction with water, nonspecific
(van der Waals) interactions having about the same free energy
in 100% ethanol as in the interior of a protein molecule. Strong
support for this idea comes from the finding that the free energy
of solvent contacts of one amino acid side chain (norleucine)
differs very little between methanol, ethanol, butanol, and ace-
tone, in contrast to the large difference between any one of these
solvents and water (9). There is also evidence that differences
between free energies of hydrophobic moieties in 100% ethanol
and the interior of detergent micelles are small (13). It is
evident that the results of this paper, since they provide com-
parable data between ethanol and dioxane, will provide additional
information on this question.

The foregoing principle cannot of course be applied to molecu-
lar moieties containing polar groups. Such groups are likely to
have specific interactions with hydroxyl, carbonyl, and other
polar groups of their environment, and, hence, unlikely to have
similar contact free energies in, say, ethanol, dioxane, and the in-
side of a protein molecule. Our studies of amino acids with polar
side chains will provide some information on this point.

For those amino acid side chains that appear to be predomi-

2211

nantly hydrophobic (i.e. have similar contact free energies in a
variety of media other than water, and a large positive contact
free energy in water, relative to all such other media) the differ-
ence between solvation free energies in water and in 100% ethanol
or other nonaqueous media may be considered as establishing a
hydrophobicity scale, which can be regarded, for example, as a
measure of the tendency of that side chain to be located in the
interior of a native protein molecule (14). The present paper
permits tryptophan and histidine side chains to be located on
such a scale. Data for these were not previously available, al-
though it has been guessed that the tryptophan side chain would
turn out to be the most hydrophobic of all protein side chains, as
indeed it will be shown to be.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

All amino acid samples used are L isomers except for glycine
and its peptides. u-Tyrosine and t-o-dibydroxyphenylalanine
were purchased from Calbiochem, and triglycine from Cyclo
Chemical Corporation. All other samples were purchased from
Mann.

i-Histidine was prepared from its hydrochloride as described
earlier (2). Diglycine was recrystallized twice from water. Tri-
glycine was recrystallized twice from water and once from aque-
ous ethanol solution. Other samples were used without further
purification.

Ethanol was purified by the method of Lund (15). -Dioxane
was Spectroquality Reagent by Matheson, Coleman and Bell and
used without further purification. Water was tin and glass
doubly distilled and freed from COsz by boiling.

The concentrations of ethanol and dioxane are expressed in
terms of the volume (milliliters) of ethanol or dioxane in 100 ml
of their aqueous mixtures.

Solubility Measuremenis—Samples and solvents were weighed
directly in glass tubes with ground glass caps and Teflon sleeves.
The air above the mixture was replaced by nitrogen. Five such
tubes were prepared routinely, containing various amounts of
sample, in such a way that two tubes would contain less than and

three others more than enough to saturate the solvent. The
tubes were shaken normally for 24 hours, sometimes longer, when
need arose, in a water bath maintained at 25.1 + 0.05°. The
solutions were separated from the saturating bodies by filtration
through long stem glass filters, while the tubes were kept partially
immersed in the bath. The supernatants thus obtained were
assayed by a dry weight method, by evaporating in a vacuum
desiccator at about 35° first and in a forced air-circulating oven
at 107° until a constant weight was obtained. For glutamine,
which undergoes a thermal decomposition on prolonged heating
at 107°, the weights in a platcau region of drying curves obtained
within several hours of heating at 107° were used for calculation.
Tyrosine and dihydroxyphenylalanine were assayed spectropho-
tometrically at 275 and 280 my, respectively.

RESULTS

The solubilities determined in this study are listed in Tables I
and H. With these data we have calculated the free energies of
trans‘er of the solutes from water to aqueous ethanol and dioxane
solutions. The free energy of transfer (A’;) has been defined as
the change in the chemical potential of solute 7 in going from
water to any other solvent, at the same mole fraction, at the limit
of infinite dilution. Since the chemical potential of solute 7, at
saturation, is the same in all solvent media, being equal to that
of the saturating body,

where p®,,. and ;° are the standard chemical potentials in water
and in the solvent to which transfer occurs, respectively; Nz,
and NV; are the solubilities in terms of mole fraction; and yi.»
and y; are the activity coefficients at saturation, defined so as to
represent the effect of solute-solute self-interaction only, solute-
solvent interaction at infinite dilution being incorporated, by this
definition, in y,° (2). A consequence of this formalism is that In
yi > 0 for every solute in cach solvent at infinite dilution, and
that u° for any solute differs in each solvent. From its defini-

¢ Where comparison is possible, the solubilities listed above agree quite well with the values given by Dunn and Ross (5), Cohn

et al. (6), and Dunn, Ross, and Read (16) (see Fig. 1).

> Different samples of amino acid sometimes give slightly different solubilities in water, possibly indicating the existence of poly-
morphic crystalline forms, such as have been described for glycine by Titaka (17). For example, the sample of tryptophan used for
solubilities in ethanol had a solubility of 1.38 g/100 g H.O, that used for the studies in dioxane (Table ID had a solubility of 1.28
g/100g H:O. Hade (18) reported a value of 1.86 g/100 g HO. Such differences do not affect the values of AF; significantly (see text).

tion, AF, is the free energy of transfer when Ni. = Ni and all
In y; vanish, ie. AF, = yi° — p?,. In terms of the solubility
measurements,

AF. = RT In Niwo/Ni + RT ly yivo/yi (2)

Experimental values for yi» are available for some cf the
solutes we have used, on the basis of the work of Smith and
Smith (19) and of Ellerton et al. (20). Reasonable estimates can
be made for amino acids for which no actual data have been re-
corded, as described in our earlier papers (2, 3). However, self-
interaction in aqueous ethanol and dioxane solutions has not been
measured, so that values of y; in such solutions have to be esti-
mated by some arbitrary procedure. This same problem was
encountered in our previous studies, and was dealt with in differ-
ent ways. In guanidine hydrochloride (4) we felt that no reason-
able basis for making an estimate exists. We therefore ignored
the self-interaction term and reported values for the parameter
AF’, defined as

AF’, = RT In Niw/Ni (3)

In urea (2) we assumed that solute concentration is the major
factor determining RT In y; and assumed that the value of RT In
7; in a mixed solvent at saturation is the sume as its value in
water at the same concentration. In ethylene glycol (3) we used
the same procedure, but, recognizing that self-interaction in
glycine, diglycine, and triglycine is likely to be predominantly
electrostatic in origin, we applied a correction for these three
solutes to take into account the reduced dielectric constant of
glycol-water mixtures. The correction consisted in multiplying
the uncorreeted value of RT In y; by Dw/D where D is the di-
electric constant of the solvent mixture, and D,, that of water.

The procedure followed here is the same as was used for ethyl
ene glycol, and the values of RT In y; obtained in this way are
shown in Tables III and IV. The figures show that the self-in-
teraction term becomes negligibly small at high concentrations of
ethanol or dioxane, because all of the measured solubilities be-
come very small under these conditions. Thus our rather ar-
bitrary method for assigning values to RT' In ; is likely to repre-
senl an unimportant source of error for the data at high ethanol
or dioxane concentration, which are in fact the data of greatest
interest.

Values of AF;, obtained according to Equation 2, with the self-
interaction terms of Tables II] and IV, are shown in Tables V

Fig. 1 shows a plot of AF; versus solvent composition for several
amino acids in aqueous ethanol! solutions. As had already been
observed by Cohn and Edsall (9), for similar plots of AF’;, there
are considerably greater changes in slope than one obtains from

solubility data in urea, or guanidine hydrochloride. The most
prominent feature is a hump-in the curves, near mole fraction
0.15 (40% ethanol by volume). ‘This feature of the results, how-
ever, does not seem to stem from the irregularity in amino acid
solubilities but is likely the result of the anomalous behavior of
water-ethanol mixtures, as reflected in measurements of viscosity,
density, vapor pressure, etc.

Similar anomalies are observed when AF, values in dioxane-

values of AF; (properly corrected for self-interaction) should be
the same for a racemic mixture as for a pure optical isomer (6, 9),
although the solubilities themselves may differ greatly. The
sclf-interaction term in a racemic mixture could differ from that
for a pure isomer because two enantiomorphs can interact with
each other in a manner not available to 2 molecules of identical
configuration. The fact that no significant differences are ob-
served between the values for these two types of isomers as shown

(Table VII and Fig. 1) further attests to the relative unimpor-
tance of the absence of precise values for the self-interaction term.

A phenomenon that may invalidate the calculation of AF; from
solubility data is the possible existence of different crystal modi-
fications for a given solute, but even then the results will be valid
if all measurements in a series refer to the same crystalline form.
Equations 1 to 3 are valid if all solubility measurements represent
saturation with respect to the same crystalline form. If one
2216

starts with two different crystalline forms, and no transformation
of one to the other occurs in the course of solubility measure-
ments, two sets of solubilities will be obtained, which will, how-
ever, give consistent A’; values. Comparison between racemic
mixtures and pure optical isomers, in efiect represents an example
of this situation. Only if changes in the solvent medium induce
a transformation in crystalline form will incorrect Af, values be
obtained. There is no evidence that any such phenomenon sig-
nificantly affected our results.

In Fig. 1 there is excellent agreement between Af; values for
leucine based on our solubility data and those based on the work
of Cohn ef al. (6), the latter comprising results both for L-leucine
and for the racemic mixture. ‘There is a discrepancy, however,
between these results and those based on the solubilities of d,l-
Jeucine by Dunn and Ross (5) and Dunn, Ross, and Read (16),
which may well be the result of saturation with respect to differ-
ent crystalline forms, since the curve representing Dunn’s data
is parallel to the curve representing the rest of the data, i.e. it
might indicate that solubility in water was measured on a differ-
ent crystal form from that existing in all of the alcohol solutions
by these authors.

Although it was not possible to extend all solubility measure-
ments to 100% ethanol or dioxane, because of the low solubility
in these solvents, Af; values for the hydrophobic side chains in
100% organic solvent are needed to generate a hydrophobicity
scale. Where necessary, results have therefore been extrap-
olated to 100% ethanol or dioxane. The extrapolation can be
done in different ways: by extrapolation of Af; itself, by extrap-
olation of AF’; values and subsequent calculation of Afi, or by
extrapolation of AF’, values and subsequent insertion of the
self-interaction term and calculation of Af; The data may be
plotted as a function of volume per cent (as in Fig. 1), molarity,
or mole fraction of solvent composition. We have found that
the result depends relatively little on the method of extrapolation,
and we believe the reliability of the extrapolated data to be

about +50 cal per mole. The results for leucine and histidine
in dioxane solution represent an exception, and the uncertainty
for these amino acid side chains is estimated at +100 cal per
mole.

It is important to note that the probable error in the self-
interaction correction for these results is very small. In deter-
mining Af, we subtract AF; for glycine from AF, for the amino
acid in question, and the self-interaction correction thus enters
into the result as

RT in! — RT In TE (4)

vi ‘YGly

where 7 refers to the amino acid whose side chain Af, is being
determined. It is evident from Tables III and IV that RT
In y; and RT In yauy are both negligibly small at the higher con-
centrations of organic solvent. Equation 4 thus reduces to
RT In Yi — RT In yeiy.w. The major contribution to this
difference comes from RT In yety,w and this is the most accurate
of all the figures in Tables III and IV, direct experimental
values determined from two laboratories (19, 20) being in ex-
cellent agreement.

DISCUSSION

Tables VII and VIII clearly confirm the very large stabiliza-
tion of hydrophobic moieties in organic solvents, relative to
water. The results obtained in ethanol and dioxane solutions
are very similar, especially at the higher concentrations of the
organic solvent.

With these results, and additional literature data for solu-
bilities in ethanol, the amino acids can be arranged in a definite
order with respect to their hydrophobicity, as shown in Table IX.
The figures given in this table replace those cited in an earlier
paper (12) as the best available estimate of hydrophobicity.
‘The table includes data not previously available (for tryptophan,
histidine, and dihydroxyphenylalanine). Other changes are
small and are caused in large part by incorporation of the self-
interaction term in Equation 2, which was neglected in the con-
struction of the earlier table.

The results show that aromatic side chains are the most
hydrophobic among the naturally occurring amino acid side
chains. This is primarily caused by the larger size of the aro-
matic groups: if the results are expressed in terms of the con-
tribution to Af; per constituent carbon atom, the aliphatic side
chains actually are more hydrophobic (e.g. leucine 450, valine
500, and phenylalanine 360).

There is a striking difference between the two heterocyclic
side chains, tryptophan and histidine. The former turns out
to be the most hydrophobic of all the amino acid side chains, and
the nitrogen atoms appear to contribute as much to the hydro-
phobicity as carbon atoms in their place would contribute. The
value of Af; per constituent atom (carbon or nitrogen) is 340
cal per mole. The histidine side chain, despite the fact that the
uncharged form was studied, receives only minimal stabilization
in the hydrophobie environment: Af, is < 100 cal per mole
per constituent atom. This discrepancy between tryptophan
and histidine has been observed in all solvents we have studied.

Another result emerging from Table IX, that has possible
theoretical significance is the effect of an OH group on hydro-
phobicity. The effect of an aliphatic OH group, by comparison
of serine with alanine and threonine with a-aminobutyric acid
(9), decreases hydrophobicity by about 800 cal per mole. The
Issue of April 10, 1971

effect of an aromatic OH group on the other hand is seen to be
much smaller: the difference in Af, between tyrosine and phenyl-
alanine is only 200 cal per mole. A second OH group (on di-
hydroxyphenylalanine) decreases the hydrophobicity by about
500 cal per mole.

It is interesting to note that the methionyl sulfur atom also
confers hydrophobic properties on the side chain. Af, for
methionine is about 740 cal per mole smaller than that for a-
aminovaleric acid (9).

Among the entities that appear to be hydrophilic (¢.e. con-
tribute to diminished solubility in ethanol or dioxane), the
backbone peptide unit stands out. Despite the possibility of
hydrogen bonding to the OH group of ethanol or the ether oxygen
atoms of dioxane, the backbone peptide unit has a strong pref-
erence for being in a purely aqueous environment. This result
undoubtedly explains why proteins dissolved in organic solvents
(e.g. 2-chloroethanol) tend to assume highly helical conforma-
tions (11, 28). Exposed peptide groups would clearly con-
tribute a relatively large positive free energy. The contribution
of a peptide unit as calculated from the comparison between
diglycine and glycine was much smaller in magnitude than the
similar contribution us calculated frum triglyvine and diglycine
in aqueous urea and guanidine hydrochloride solutions, and
they were about equal in aqueous glycol solutions. The trend
observed in aqueous ethanol and dioxane solutions is just op-
posite to that in urea and guanidine hydrochloride solutions, as
shown in Tables VIJ and VII. However it can be seen that the
values obtained by both ways become closer rather rapidly as
ethanol concentration approaches 100%.

It has been observed in all our solubility studies that the
results obtained for asparagine cannot be reconciled with those
for glutamine. Asparagine consistently shows more negative
AF, values than those of glutamine, while one expects the op-
posite trend, since glutamine has an additional CH2 group which
in our solvent systems should show a negative contribution to
AF. In our previous paper, we have shown that the free energy
contributions from glutamine side chains for the transfer from
waler lo aqueous guanidine hydrochloride, urea, and ethylene-
glycol are essentially identical with the sum of independent
contributions from the amide group CH2zCONH: and a methylene
group (4). It is therefore likely that asparagine is the one
which shows anomalous behavior and glutamine is not. Part of
the explanation for this anomalous behavior may arise from the
tendency of asparagine to form ring structures. X-ray diffrac-
tion studies of Kartha and de Vries (24) show that in asparagine
monohydrate crystal a ring structure is formed, probably through
a weak hydrogen bond between the a-amino nitrogen atom and

Y. Nozaki and C. Tanford

2217

the oxygen atom of the amide group. On the other hand, no
such ring structure was found in the study of glutamine crystals
by Cochran and Penfold (25). This cannot, however, be the
whole explanation, because the anomalous behavior is too
irregular: for transfer from water to 90% ethylene glycol, for
example, Af, is — 830 cal per mole for the asparagine side chain
and + 60 cal per mole for glutamine. In ethanol and dioxane
the results for the two side chains are nearly the same.

It seems probable, therefore, that both asparagine and glu-
tamine can adopt more than one conformation, involving internal
hydrogen bonds, as well as hydrogen bonds with solvent mole-
cules. The values of Af, would then reflect alterations in the
equilibria between the possible conformations, as well as the
simple effect of environment on a molecule of unchanging con-
formation.
